# chrome-extension-tutorial
My first attempt at creating a Chrome web extension using Google's official [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted). 

## What Does an Extension Need?
An extension is made up of several **components** and a JSON **manifest** file. 

### What is a Manifest File?
According to _Wikipedia_, a manifest file is "a file containing **metadata** for a group of accompanying files that are part of a set or coherent unit<sup>1</sup>. 

The manifest file contains important information for our extension. It can contain our extension [name](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/name#name), the current [version](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/version) of our extension and manifest, [icons](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/icons), and more.

A manifest file is required for both Chrome extensions and Chrome web applications. Note that what the manifest file contains may differ. For more information, you can refer to the links below:
* Web applications: https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest
* Web extensions: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest

## More Resources
* Google provides much more detailed information about the overall **architecture** of extensions, which can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/overview). 
* For a guide targeted towards **developers**, Google has also provided a [developer guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide).  
* Have trouble **debugging**? Please see Google's tutorial on [debugging here](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/tut_debugging).
* Want to use **APIs** with your extension? Google's got your back [here](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/api_index)!
