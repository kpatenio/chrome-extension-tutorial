# chrome-extension-tutorial
My first attempt at creating a Chrome web extension using Google's official [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted). 

## What Does an Extension Need?
An extension is made up of several **components** and a JSON **manifest** file. 

### What is a Manifest File?
The manifest file contains important information for our extension. It can contain our extension [name](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/name#name), the current [version](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/version) of our extension and manifest, [icons](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/icons), and more.

For more information, please see: https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest.
